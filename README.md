# Self-Learning using Reward Feedback Signals in Spiking Neural Networks

### @author Nicola Russo, BSc, MSc

Neuromorphic computing is promising to become the new standard in low-
power AI applications. The formulation of models involving Spiking Neural
Networks (SNN) capable to simulate the human brain self-learning process
is an open challenge. In this Thesis we aim to investigate how these mecha-
nisms work applying it to the goalkeeper task. Neuromorphic hardware like
Dynamic Vision Sensor, Microcontroller, sensors and the SpiNNaker board
work together thanks to our new “SpiNNalink” Interface Board, that guar-
antees fast communication and low power consumption. Furthermore, we
build a SNN model able to use a reward signal to self-learn and predict the
unknown trajectories of the ball launched towards the goal.
